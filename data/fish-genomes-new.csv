The primary contigs were then scaffolded using the 10X data with scaff10x; then scaffolded further with BioNano hybrid scaffolding and scaffolded further still using the Hi-C data with SALSA2. Polishing and gap-filling of both the primary scaffolds and haplotigs was performed using the PacBio reads and Arrow; followed by two rounds of Illumina polishing using the 10X data and freebayes. The mitochondrial assembly was produced at The Rockefeller University using mitoVGP. Finally; the assembly was manually improved using gEVAL to correct mis-joins; improve concordance with the BioNano and Hi-C data and remove retained haplotypic duplication using purge_haplotigs. Chromosomes identified from the Hi-C data have been named in order of size,924,3059612,460,22793177,512.553,43.622
